# AnyWars: A Codewars-like Learning Environment for Any Technical Skill

AnyWars is a system for replicating the Codewars learning approach for any technical skill, not just algorithms and math programming.

## What makes Codewars effective:
1. It's focused on improvement for its own sake, not interview prep
2. It forces you to solve problems without access to solutions
3. After solving a problem, you can see ranked solutions from others (best practice, clever, etc.)
4. The kyu ranking system (8-1) provides progressive difficulty

## How AnyWars works:
I'll use Claude to simulate this environment for learning any technical skill I want to improve in. The workflow includes:
1. Getting a problem at my chosen difficulty level
2. Submitting a solution
3. Running tests to verify my solution
4. Only after passing tests, seeing better solution approaches
5. Learning from these examples to improve my skills

To use this system, I'll ask Claude to:
1. Generate a challenge in my chosen domain at a specific kyu level
2. Help set up test suites (initial visible tests and hidden tests)
3. Verify my solutions against these test suites
4. Only reveal better approaches after I've successfully solved the problem myself

This is an effective learning approach because it combines:
- Active problem-solving without reference materials
- Immediate feedback through testing
- Learning from examples after personal effort
- Progressive difficulty scaling
