# Shell Scripting with Bash

This domain focuses on practical Bash shell scripting skills that are useful in real-world contexts, rather than abstract algorithmic problems. Challenges are designed to build competency in automation, text processing, system administration, and other common shell scripting tasks.

## Focus Areas

### Text Processing and Manipulation
- Using tools like `grep`, `sed`, `awk`, and `cut`
- Regular expressions for pattern matching
- Transforming and formatting text data
- Parsing structured and unstructured data

### File System Operations
- File and directory management
- Finding and filtering files based on criteria
- Batch processing of files
- Working with file permissions and ownership

### Process Management
- Running and controlling processes
- Job control and background processing
- Inter-process communication
- Handling signals and process termination

### System Monitoring and Diagnostics
- Resource usage monitoring (CPU, memory, disk)
- Log file analysis and reporting
- System health checks
- Alerting and notification scripts

### Task Automation
- Scheduled tasks with cron
- Batch processing workflows
- Automating repetitive administration tasks
- Creating wrapper scripts for complex operations

### Error Handling and Debugging
- Robust error checking
- Logging and debugging techniques
- Input validation and sanitization
- Creating fault-tolerant scripts

### Performance Optimization
- Reducing runtime and resource usage
- Parallelization techniques
- Efficient data processing
- Minimizing external process calls

## Learning Path

Start with 8 kyu challenges and progress through the levels as your skills improve:

- **8 kyu**: Basic commands, simple scripts, fundamental concepts
- **7 kyu**: Combining tools, basic control flow, file operations
- **6 kyu**: Regular expressions, more advanced text processing, automation
- **5 kyu**: Error handling, robust scripts, system monitoring
- **4 kyu**: Complex data processing, performance optimization
- **3 kyu**: Advanced automation workflows, systems integration
- **2 kyu**: Production-quality scripts, complex system management
- **1 kyu**: Expert-level automation, creating comprehensive tooling

## Example Challenge Types

- Create a script to process log files and extract specific information
- Build a monitoring solution for system resources
- Automate repetitive system administration tasks
- Write robust scripts with proper error handling and validation
- Develop a tool for batch processing of files
- Optimize an existing shell script for performance
- Create a solution for parsing and transforming structured data
- Build a diagnostic tool for troubleshooting system issues
